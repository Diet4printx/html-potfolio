<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, My name is Ashi Oryiman Ernest and i am currently in 400L. I have been in the universty for four years now; 
  I joined at the start of 100L, and have thoroughly enjoyed my self here. The school is great, the people are fantastic 
  and the atmosphere is one that makes you actually want to go to school. I was born and raised in Makurdi city and grew 
  up there.

<p>I am an interesting, fun loving guy with a good sense of humor. One thing about me that is important to know though 
  is that at first I come of as a very shy individualistic guy but once I get to know people and are comfortable with my 
  environment I am great. It is hard for me to make friends but once I make them, it’s great and I am all different. 
  I joke, laugh and humor people and I also get as much as I give. I am a very kind, compassionate, sensitive guy as 
  my close friends will tell you. I have a tough shell but on the inside I am soft. I am also a very principled person 
  and stand strong on what is right and wrong. I am also a very straight and honest person. I understand and know that 
  we all put on a show sometimes and do not show who we really are or what we feel but some people do this constantly 
  and those kinds of people I cannot stand.</p>

<p>Academically I am a student who likes to be mentally challenged and I enjoy both hands on projects as well as 
  conventional learning. I am a skilled tech student and I love technology. I also enjoy computer Programming and 
  Engineering drawing. I had many different types of roles in both small and large productions at a refinery. I enjoy 
  TOK class as it is often different from other classes but yet as meaningful. It provides you with great insight on 
  many things one does not normally think about.</p>

<p>I began to get fascinated by our capitalist world’s economy at a very early age of my life. Growing up, I was 
  incredibly curious to unravel how systems function, and this curiosity developed into a burning desire to learn how 
  processes and organizations operate and run our world. As I started my first job, I realized how much I needed to be 
  better acquainted with the science of money making and the scientific approaches to money management. Later on in my 
  life, being within a company system, I wanted to see the big picture by learning where such a company stands in the 
  midst of all other business interactions locally and internationally. Being involved in the company’s practices 
  I started analyzing the methods used by my managers, the causes and consequences of their managerial choices.</p> 

  <p>In conclusion; Students today believe in their technology skills as a result of being familiar with technology 
    in their daily lives. However, there is a need to examine students’ perception about their technology skills to 
    determine what the students’ technology skill levels actually are; especially their prior knowledge in relation 
    to school-related expectations. Indeed, the technology skills that students need to apply in their learning are 
    not necessarily related to those they use in their social lives and may not transfer properly when used for 
    knowledge building. Moreover, the real meaning of technology literacy is not about the ability to play a game, 
    do basic word processing, send e-mail or browse the Web. These skills are not sufficient for students to be 
    considered technology literate. It is about the meaningful use of these skills to enhance their learning. 
    On the other hand, students can integrate technology skills in their learning when they use technology as tools 
    for organization, communication, research, and problem solving. Also, these skills cannot be practiced separately 
    but should be a part of each instructional event during school, in any subject (Eisenberg, Johnson, & Berkowitz, 
    2010).
          Using technology as a tool is a fundamental concept to improve students learning. Thus, teachers should 
          accentuate optimal tactics for using educational technology, through their instruction, and provide the 
          opportunities that will result in students gaining improved technology skills.</p>
